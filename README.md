# Landing Page Update for 2021

I guess it's just refreshing to update your landing page every now and then...
I'm using TailwindCSS for styling this time as I heard it's more convinient
This time I took a less simple design compared to my last landing page (which is a bare minimum for design)
I tried to match the color palette with the my picture on the home screen of the Landing page.
